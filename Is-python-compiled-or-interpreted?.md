There are 2 types of translators: Compiler, Interpreter

## What is a Compiler ?

C language uses compiler.
Compiler converts high level code to an executable code and this executable code file just needs to be run to start the code.
The executable file generated in windows has an extension .exe whereas the file has extension .app in Mac.

Interpreter converts code on the fly.Line by line when the code is run. Copy of the source code has to be provided
Interpreter never generates an executable unlike a compiler.

## Is python compiled or interpreted
Python is both compiled and interpreted language.

Source code(.py) ----> Compiler----> Bytecode(.pyc)
PVM (can be installed on Linux/Windows/Max) Interpreter is a part of PVM.
PVM converts byte code to machine code.

### How to see the bytecode - its never visible otherwise

Any machine that has a PVM installed on it can run this file.
